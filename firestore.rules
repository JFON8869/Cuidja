/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a user-centric and role-based security model for a marketplace application.
 * The core principle is that users own and control their personal data, sellers own and control their stores and products,
 * and transactional data (orders) is accessible only to the involved participants (buyer and seller).
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into flat, top-level collections (users, stores, products, orders, reviews).
 * This structure simplifies rule logic. Authorization is handled by denormalizing ownership information (like `userId`, `storeId`) 
 * directly onto the documents being secured.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All access is denied by default, and permissions are granted explicitly.
 * - User Data Privacy: A user's profile document is private and can only be read or modified by that specific user. User listing is disabled.
 * - Public Listings: Store profiles and product catalogs are publicly readable to allow browsing by any user (including unauthenticated ones),
 *   but write operations are strictly limited to the authenticated owners.
 * - Transactional Privacy: Orders are private. Access is restricted to the specific buyer and seller involved in that transaction.
 *   Open listing of orders is disabled to prevent data leakage.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Ownership is determined by `userId` fields on documents. To secure products and orders, which are
 *   linked to a store, a `get()` call is used to fetch the store's `userId`. This is a necessary trade-off when the owner's UID is not
 *   denormalized onto every single sub-document.
 * - Immutability: Critical relational identifiers (like `userId`, `storeId`, `buyerId`) are enforced as immutable after creation to maintain
 *   data integrity and prevent ownership hijacking.
 * - Schema Validation: Incoming data for create and update operations is validated against a defined schema to ensure type safety and integrity.
